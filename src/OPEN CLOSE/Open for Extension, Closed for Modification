Simply::
    Class Shoud be open for extension but closed for modification. in doing so we stop ourselves from modifying
    existing code and causing potential new bugs in an otherwise happy application.

    Example::
    public class Guitar{
        private String make;
        private String model;
        private int volume;

        //Constructor, getters & setters


    }

    we launch the application, and everyone loves it, but after a few month, we decide the Guitar is a little boring
    and Could use a cool flame pattern to make it look more rock and roll.
    at this point it, might be tempting to just open up the Guitar class and add a flame pattern- but who knows what
    errors that might throw up in our application, instead let's stick to the open-closed principle and simply extend
    our guitar class::

    public class SuperCoolGuitarWithFlames extend Guitar{
        private String flameColor;

        //constructors getters and setters
    }

    By extending the guitar class we can be sure that our existing application won't be affected.
