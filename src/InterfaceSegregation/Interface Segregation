it Simply means that larger interface should be split into smaller ones.
By doing so, we can unsure that implementing classes only need to be concerned about the methods
that are of intereset to them

    for this example, we are going to try our hands as zookeepers. And more specifically, we will be working in the bear enclosure.
    Lets start with an interface that outlines our roles as a bear keeper:

        public interface BearKeeper {

            void washTheBear();
            void feedTheBear();
            void petTheBear();

        }

        as avid zookepers, we are more than happy to wash and feed our beloved bears, but we are all to aware of the
        dangers of petting them, unfortunately, our interface is rather large, and we have no choice but implement the code to pet the bear.
        lets fix this by splitting our large interface into three separate ones:
            public interface BearCleaner {
                void washTheBear();
            }

            public interface BearFeeder {
                void feedTheBear();
            }

            public interface BearPetter {
                void petTheBear();
            }

            now thanks to interface segregation, we are free to implement only the methods that matter to us:
            public class BearCarer implements BearCleaner, BearFeeder {

                public void washTheBear() {
                    //I think we missed a spot...
                }

                public void feedTheBear() {
                    //Tuna Tuesdays...
                }
            }

            and finally, we can leave the dangerous stuff to the reckless people:
            public class CrazyPerson implements BearPetter {

                public void petTheBear() {
                    //Good luck with that!
                }
            }
            going further, we could even split our BookPrinter class from our example earlier to use interface segregation in the same way
            by implementing a printerInterface with a single print method, we could instantiate separate ConsoleBookPrinter and otherMediaBookPrinter classes
